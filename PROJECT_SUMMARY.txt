3. Brief Documentation
----------------------
Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Data: JSON files (mockReviews.json, approvedReviews.json)

Key Design & Logic Decisions:
- Manager dashboard for review management (private)
- Public property page for guests (approved reviews only)
- Review approval system (writes to approvedReviews.json)
- Filtering, searching, sorting, and statistics on reviews
- RESTful API endpoints for all review operations
- Data normalization for consistent review format

API Behaviors:
- `/hostaway`: Get all reviews
- `/search`: Filter reviews by property, rating, type, status
- `/stats`: Get review statistics
- `/approved`: Get approved reviews
- `/:id/approve`: Approve/unapprove reviews
- All endpoints return JSON with status, count, and reviews

Google Reviews Findings:
- Integration guide for Google Places API provided
- Backend service example using `@googlemaps/google-maps-services-js`
- API route for `/google/:placeId` documented
- Frontend fetch and display logic included
- Limitations: Only 5 most recent reviews, API costs, rate limits, public reviews only
- Alternative: Google My Business API (requires OAuth, business verification)
- Not recommended: Web scraping (TOS violation)
- Recommended: Hybrid display (Hostaway + Google reviews, separate tabs)
